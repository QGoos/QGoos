- Hi, I’m @Quinton
- I’m interested in Machine learning and AI, in fact I actually have a degree in Machine Learning and Data Mining
- I’m currently learning to expand my knowledgebase of programming languages working on adding C++ to those I am already familiar with which include C, Java, Python and R to name those I have worked with the most with less experience in javascript, HTLM, and php
- I can be contacted at qgoos@hotmail.com
